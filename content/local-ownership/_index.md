## Relay Routers 
Cony Internet is seeking passionate and enterprising community members of Van Wyck to connect Relay Routers to our wireless mesh. We provide the equipment, which is lightweight, low-power, and modern, and install the equipment. These are the only up front costs -- from then on, the partner owns the equipment entirely and earns passive income on their investment. 

- Earn passive income by furnishing neighbors with wireless hops. 
- Support the connection to your neighbors and friends with communication and trade!
- Engage and Empower the spirit of community enterprise.

## Open and Local 
Furthermore, Cony services Van Wyck's internet through the Port of Bellingham's global fiber connection -- a publicly-owned utility. And all of our partner Althea's software is open source! Eventually, Cony aims to manufacture our own open hardware platform. That goal is a long ways off. 

- Own your own hardware - unlike other telecoms, we never rent our hardware out. 
- If you already own a high-quality router, it can be flashed with Althea's firmware to subscribe to Cony Internet. 
- Recirculate your money into your local economy.
- Take ownership of your digital life with the right to repair and understand your networking gear. 
- Support Public Broadband.
