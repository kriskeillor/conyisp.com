## Relay Routers 
Cony Internet is seeking passionate and enterprising community members of Van Wyck to connect Relay Routers to our wireless mesh. By purchasing hardware directly from [Althea's store](https://althea-routers.myshopify.com/), you can invest in powerful and lightweight equipment that will earn you passive income as long as its relaying Althea traffic. 

We provide the equipment, which is lightweight, low-power, and modern, and install the equipment. These are the only up front costs -- from then on, the partner owns the equipment entirely and earns passive income on their investment. 

- Earn passive income by furnishing neighbors with wireless hops. 
- Support the connection to your neighbors and friends with communication and trade!
- Engage and Empower the spirit of community enterprise. 

**Relay Router Interest Form forthcoming!** 

## Open and Local 
Furthermore, Cony intends to service Van Wyck's internet through the Port of Bellingham's global fiber connection -- a publicly-owned utility. And all of Althea's software is open source! Eventually, Cony aims to manufacture our own open hardware platform. That goal is a long ways off. 

- Own your own hardware investment. 
- If you already own a high-quality router, it can be flashed with Althea's firmware to subscribe to Cony Internet. 
- Recirculate your money into your local economy.
- Take ownership of your digital life with the right to repair and understand your networking gear. 
- Support Public Broadband.
