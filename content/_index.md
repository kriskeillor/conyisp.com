        <td>The Port of Bellingham <a href="https://www.commonthreadsnw.org/news/local-government/citizen-journalism-port-of-bellingham-meeting-report-for-mar-5-2019/">announces the results of their Rural Broadband Fiber Feasibility Study</a>. The Port "hopes to encourage Internet Service Providers to lease strands on this network and to develop the incentive for competition which will affordably provide service to local internet-deserts."</td>

        <td>November 2019</td>
        <td>Scouting for the best location for an Altheahood in Whatcom County begins. Prospective sites included South Hill, Sehome, Dewey/Van Wyck, Deming, and Nugent's Corner. Ultimately, Van Wyck was selected for its proximity to the Port's rural fiber and the lack of serious competitors willing to invest in the community.</td>

This name has been abandoned due to competing small ISPs, across the country and world, going by WISE. The Port of Bellingham, Althea team, and trusted mentors all assisted with business development.
