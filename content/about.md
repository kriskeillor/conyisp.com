Cony ISP is a Sole Proprietorship established in 2020 by Kris Keillor, a Junior studying Electrical and Computer Engineering at Western Washington University. Kris has a proven track record in computer and information services.

A self-taught programmer, Kris has applied his computer skills to disaster relief, enterprise information technology, and software quality assurance. Transitioning to Electrical and Computer Engineering, Kris hopes to understand the *full* hardware *and* software stack of modern communications. The ultimate goal is to develop open hardware RF gear to deploy to, and prove on, Cony's network. A more free, open, fair, and transparent society & economy is the ultimate goal of all efforts.

Kris's family is deeply rooted in the Pacific Northwest; his parents hail from Oregon's Willamette Valley, leaving only for his father's international Air Force service. After retirement, the family settled in Eastern Washington. Kris fell in love with Bellingham on a road trip and hopes to build a life and career here after graduating from WWU in Spring 2022.
