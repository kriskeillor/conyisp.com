                    <p>Cony is bringing fast, affordable internet connectivity to a neighborhood underserved by big telecoms: Van Wyck, Whatcom Co., Washington State. No longer will Van Wyck be subjected to outrageous rates, hidden fees, equipment rentals, or data caps. <br><br> By partnering with the Port of Bellingham and Althea by Hawk Networks, Cony empowers Van Wyck with a resilient, well-priced, and community owned & operated Internet Service Provider.<br><br><a href='/signup' style='color:white;'>Sign Up</a><br><a href='/contact' style='color:white;'>Contact your Organizer</a></p>

    <h2 id="relay-routers">Relay Routers</h2>
<p>Cony Internet is seeking passionate and enterprising community members of Van Wyck to connect Relay Routers to our wireless mesh. By purchasing hardware directly from <a href="https://althea-routers.myshopify.com/">Althea's store</a>, you can invest in powerful and lightweight equipment that will earn you passive income as long as its relaying Althea traffic. </p>
<p>We provide the equipment, which is lightweight, low-power, and modern, and install the equipment. These are the only up front costs -- from then on, the partner owns the equipment entirely and earns passive income on their investment. </p>
<ul>
<li>Earn passive income by furnishing neighbors with wireless hops. </li>
<li>Support the connection to your neighbors and friends with communication and trade!</li>
<li>Engage and Empower the spirit of community enterprise. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Relay Router Interest Form forthcoming!</strong> </p>
<h2 id="open-and-local">Open and Local</h2>
<p>Furthermore, Cony intends to service Van Wyck's internet through the Port of Bellingham's global fiber connection -- a publicly-owned utility. And all of Althea's software is open source! Eventually, Cony aims to manufacture our own open hardware platform. That goal is a long ways off. </p>
<ul>
<li>Own your own hardware investment. </li>
<li>If you already own a high-quality router, it can be flashed with Althea's firmware to subscribe to Cony Internet. </li>
<li>Recirculate your money into your local economy.</li>
<li>Take ownership of your digital life with the right to repair and understand your networking gear. </li>
<li>Support Public Broadband. </li>
</ul>
