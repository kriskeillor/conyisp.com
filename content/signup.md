Signups for Cony's Internet Services are managed through our partner, Althea. Simply follow this link to sign up: 

<h3 style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://althea.net/vanwyck">althea.net/vanwyck</a></h3>

You should see a form like this: 

<img src="/images/althea-pre-registration-form.png"/>

That will give both the Cony and Althea teams the ability to reach out to you.  
Additionally, you should get a postcard in the mail. The code on that postcard will confirm your pre-registration and ability to join the network.
