Although the exact speed achievable at a subscriber's house or business can't be known until they [sign up](/signup) and schedule an inspection, the insultingly low bar of 25 Mbps down/3 Mbps up set by the big telecoms is usually blown out of the water. Despite charging [low prices](/low-price), Cony uses top-grade modern equipment. Most subscribers can expect 50 to 70 Mbps down *and* up. 

Furthermore, we do not divide subscribers into tiers or grades. Nor do we ever throttle traffic. As more subscribers join the mesh network, instead of congesting it actually becomes more resilient and responsive. All this traffic is encrypted end-to-end so no one, not even Cony, will inspect or sell your personal data. 

- Typical download speeds of 50 to 70 Mbps. 
- Faster speeds achievable if subscriber and neighbors opt for upgraded equipment. 
- Flat rate charged for data!
- No throttling or data caps!
- Encrypted end-to-end!
