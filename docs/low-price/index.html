                    <h1>A lightning-fast, pay-as-you-go internet provider for Van Wyck.</h1>
                    <p>Cony is bringing fast, affordable internet connectivity to a neighborhood underserved by big telecoms: Van Wyck, Whatcom Co., Washington State. No longer will Van Wyck be charged outrageous rates, hidden fees, equipment rentals, or data caps. <br><br> By partnering with the Port of Bellingham and Althea by Hawk Networks, Cony empowers Van Wyck with a resilient, well-priced, and community owned & operated Internet Service Provider.</p>

            <div style="width: 80%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
    <p>By building a lightweight wireless mesh network, instead of a traditional one-to-many wired network, Cony requires far less actual hardware and construction to service Van Wyck. These savings are all passed on to our community parters and members. </p>
<p>Cony does not charge piecemeal speed tiers or throttle data. Network subscribers are only charged for their actual data usage. Meaning, in a month where you used little to no data, you would only be charged the low monthly communition subscription fee ($10). The actual per-data fees -- charged by the gigabyte -- are so low that most subscribers pay only about $35 to $45 a month for a <a href="/high-speed">high-speed connection</a>. Some of this money is paid out to <a href="/local-ownership">local network partners</a> in the form of Dai, a crytocurrency stabilized by USD.</p>
<p>Again, speeds are not determined by any type of tier or membership level, but simply the strength of the wireless mesh in that area and the quality of the equipment the subscriber is using. Technically, any platform that can run Althea's <a href="https://github.com/althea-net/althea-firmware">open-source OpenWRT fork</a> and wirelessly transcieve can subscribe! However, Cony recommends and supplies commercial-grade <a href="https://www.ui.com/">Ubiquiti</a> equipment. </p>

<li>Low, fair, per-Gb data prices!</li>
<li>If you don't use data, you don't pay!</li>
<li>Lightweight Infrastructure reduces environmental costs and impact. </li>
<li>Community Fee supports community discussion and includes membership in the neighborhood DAO.</li>
