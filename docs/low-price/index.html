                    <p>Cony is bringing fast, affordable internet connectivity to a neighborhood underserved by big telecoms: Van Wyck, Whatcom Co., Washington State. No longer will Van Wyck be subjected to outrageous rates, hidden fees, equipment rentals, or data caps. <br><br> By partnering with the Port of Bellingham and Althea by Hawk Networks, Cony empowers Van Wyck with a resilient, well-priced, and community owned & operated Internet Service Provider.<br><br><a href='/signup' style='color:white;'>Sign Up</a><br><a href='/contact' style='color:white;'>Contact your Organizer</a></p>

    <p>By building a lightweight wireless mesh network, instead of a traditional centralized hardline network, Cony requires far less actual hardware and construction to service Van Wyck. These savings are all passed on to our subscribers and community parters.</p>
<p>For an estimate of pricing based on your usage and depth into the mesh, first, write down your monthly data usage as reported by your current ISP. Then, <a href="https://conyisp.com/contact/">contact your organizer</a> or the relay operator to determine how deep into the mesh you are. Finally, knowing your usage and mesh depth, refer to our <a href="https://conyisp.com/low-price/estimate/">estimation table</a>. Payments may be subject to change.</p>
<p>Cony does not throttle your speed or data. Subscribers are charged only a low monthly community fee, expected to be $16, and per-gigabyte data usage fees. Meaning, in a month where you used little to no data, your internet bill would be proportionally small. The actual per-data fees -- charged by the gigabyte -- are so low that most subscribers pay only about $35 to $45 a month for a <a href="/high-speed">high-speed connection</a>. Some of this money is paid out to <a href="/local-ownership">local network partners</a> in the form of Dai, a crytocurrency stabilized by USD.</p>
<p>Again, speeds are not determined by any type of tier or membership level, but simply the strength of the wireless mesh in that area and the quality of the equipment the subscriber is using. Technically, any platform that can run Althea's open-source <a href="https://github.com/althea-net/althea-firmware" target="_blank">OpenWRT fork</a> and wirelessly transcieve can subscribe! However, Cony recommends and supplies commercial-grade Ubiquiti equipment <a href="https://althea-routers.myshopify.com/" target="_blank">pre-configured by Althea</a>.</p>
<p>Unless you can flash your own router or build a WiFi antenna, hardware must be purchased from Althea or leased from Cony. In the former case, no-interest 6-month payment plans are available and the hardware is yours to keep for life.</p>
