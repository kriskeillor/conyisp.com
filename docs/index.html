                    <h1>A lightning-fast, pay-as-you-go internet provider for Van Wyck.</h1>
                    <p>Cony is bringing fast, affordable internet connectivity to a neighborhood underserved by big telecoms: Van Wyck, Whatcom Co., Washington State. No longer will Van Wyck be charged outrageous rates, hidden fees, equipment rentals, or data caps. <br><br> By partnering with the Port of Bellingham and Althea by Hawk Networks, Cony empowers Van Wyck with a resilient, well-priced, and community owned & operated Internet Service Provider.</p>

            </h2>
            <p>Because anybody in Van Wyck can connect a node or relay to expand Cony's Altheahood - earning passive income on their effort - the provider mesh continues to grow faster and stronger.</p>

            </h2>
            <p>Cony Internet is operated by a student at WWU. The relays are owned by local residents and businesses. Rather than funneling money to a faraway corporate ISP, Cony encourages the community of Van Wyck to re-invest in itself.</p>

            </h2>
            <p>Because Althea routers automatically select the best route - only paying for their data usage and a fixed monthly membership - you'll get the best service at the lowest price. Hands-free.</p>

Ultimately, Van Wyck was selected for its proximity to the Port's rural fiber and the lack of serious competitors willing to invest in the community.</td>
