        <td>Scouting for the best location for an Altheahood in Whatcom County begins. Prospective sites included South Hill, Sehome, Dewey & Van Wyck, Deming, and Nugent's Corner. Ultimately, Dewey & Van Wyck was selected for its proximity to the Port's rural fiber and the lack of serious competitors willing to invest in the community.
        <br/><br/>
        Business development begins under the codename ***WISE***. The Port of Bellingham, Althea team, and trusted mentors all assisted with business development.</td>
