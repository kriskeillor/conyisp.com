Although the exact speed achievable at a subscriber's house or business can't be known until they [sign up](/signup) and schedule a survey, the Ubiquiti RF gear Cony uses is rated at 450 Mbps+ symmetric. This means that when attending two-way video conferencing or streams, your performance out will be as good as your performance in. 

For the service alpha, Cony is committed to sourcing a 450 Mbps+ global connection. Limiting relays to five subscribers guarantees at least 90 Mbps symmetric to all subscribers. Again, speeds are not determined by pricing tiers, but the overall health and "meshiness" of the network. As it grows, resiliency will too. 

Furthermore, we do not divide subscribers into tiers or grades. Nor do we ever throttle traffic. As more subscribers join the mesh network, instead of congesting it actually becomes more resilient and responsive. All this traffic is encrypted end-to-end so no one, not even Cony, will inspect or sell your personal data. 

- Typical download speeds of 50 to 70 Mbps. 
- Faster speeds achievable if subscriber and neighbors opt for upgraded equipment. 
- Flat rate charged for data!
- No throttling or data caps!
- Encrypted end-to-end!
